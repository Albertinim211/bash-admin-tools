Project: Automated Linux Hardening

Overview
A professional Bash utility designed to automate the security hardening of Ubuntu/Debian-based servers. This project demonstrates skills in System Administration, Network Security, and Automation.

Key Features

Identity & Access Management: Audits the /etc/passwd file to identify unauthorized root-level accounts.


Network Security: Implements a "Deny All" incoming firewall policy using UFW, specifically allowing only SSH traffic.


Attack Surface Reduction: Automatically identifies and disables non-essential services like avahi-daemon and cups.


Compliance & Maintenance: Sets up a cron job to automate system security patches daily at 2:00 AM.

Skills Demonstrated

Linux Admin: File system hierarchy, package management, and systemd service control.


Security: Least-privilege enforcement and vulnerability mitigation.


Scripting: Logic flow and automation in Bash.

3. Visualizing the Project Flow
Even without a terminal, you can explain the logic to a recruiter. Your script follows a professional Security Hardening Workflow:

Why this works for you:

Proof of Knowledge: It proves you understand User Management and Permission Handling.


Professionalism: It shows you document your work, which is a requirement for roles using Jira or ServiceNow.


Certification Alignment: It directly applies the concepts from your CCNA (Firewalls/ACLs) and Security+ (Least Privilege).
